# BM4Ckit
## Batched Machine-learning for Catalysts kit
A Python-based package containing various tools for machine learning applied in catalytic chemistry, 
including reading, writing, filtering, modifying, and format conversion of batched structure files, training ML models, model predictions, ML-potential-based batched structure optimization and molecular dynamics, etc.

Manuals would be completed soon. You can find the current manuals in [Manual](Manual/).

The project is still in an early version and may change significantly in the future.
